                    draft-wessels-dns-zone-digest-00

Abstract

   This document describes a protocol and DNS Resource Record used to
   provide a message digest over DNS zone data.  In particular, it
   describes how to compute, sign, represent, and use the message digest
   to verify the contents of a zone for accuracy and completeness.  The
   ZONEMD Resource Record type is introduced for conveying the message
   digest data.

1.  Introduction

   In the DNS, a zone is the collection of authoritative resource
   records (RRs) sharing a common origin ([RFC7719]), which can be
   distributed from primary to secondary name servers.  Zones are often
   stored as files on disk in the so-called master file format
   [RFC1034].  Sometimes zones are distributed outside of the DNS, with
   such protocols as FTP, HTTP, rsync, and so on.  While zone files are

Internet-Draft               DNS Zone Digest                  March 2018


   self-contained, currently there is no way to verify the authenticity
   of a stand-alone zone file.

   This document introduces a new RR type that serves as a cryptographic
   message digest of the data in a zone file.  It allows a receiver of
   the zone file to verify its authenticity, especially when used in
   combination with DNSSEC.

   Message digests are also found in the TSIG protocol.  DNS transaction
   signatures (TSIG [RFC2845]) uses a message digest to protect
   individual query and response messages.  TSIG is generally used to
   authenticate and validate UPDATE [RFC2136] AXFR [RFC5936], and IXFR
   [RFC1995] messages.  However, TSIG's protections are ephemeral,
   existing only "on the wire," and are not retained after the
   transaction is complete.  Additionally, TSIG utilizes shared secret
   keys, which are not available to third parties.

   The technique described in this document makes the message digest a
   part of the zone file itself, and allows anyone to verify the zone
   file as a whole, no matter how it is transmitted.

   DNSSEC provides three strong security guarantees relevant to this
   protocol:

   1.  whether or not to expect DNSSEC records in the zone,

   2.  whether or not to expect a ZONEMD record in a signed zone, and

   3.  whether or not the ZONEMD record has been altered since it was
       signed.

   FOR DISCUSSION: currently this document does not require DNSSEC.
   Should it be a prerequisite?

   The motivation for including a message digest in a zone file comes
   largely from the DNS root zone.  At the time of this writing, there
   is increased attention to the idea of widely distributing the root
   zone, beyond the root server system.  [RFC7706] describes how a
   recursive resolver can serve the root zone via a loopback address.
   As the root zone spreads beyond its traditional deployment
   boundaries, the need for verification of the zone contents becomes
   increasingly important.

   Nothing in this specification, however, is specific to the root zone.
   The zone digest is designed to work for any DNS zone.

   This specification is OPTIONAL to implement by both publishers and
   consumers of zone file data.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  The ZONEMD Resource Record

   This section describes the ZONEMD Resource Record, including its
   fields, wire format, and presentation format.  The Type value for the
   ZONEMD RR is TBD.  The ZONEMD RR is class independent.  The RDATA of
   the resource record consists of three fields: Serial, Digest Type,
   and Digest.

   FOR DISCUSSION: This document is currently written as though a zone
   MUST NOT contain more than one ZONEMD RR.  Having exactly one ZONEMD
   record per zone simplifies this protocol and eliminates confusion
   around downgrade attacks, at the expense of algorithm agility.

3.1.  ZONEMD RDATA Wire Format

   The ZONEMD RDATA wire format is encoded as follows:

                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                             Serial                            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Digest Type  |                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+             Digest                            +
   /                                                               /
   /                                                               /
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

3.1.1.  The Serial Field

   The Serial field is a 32-bit unsigned integer in network order.  It
   is equal to the serial number from the zone's SOA record ([RFC1035]
   section 3.3.13) for which the message digest was generated.

   FOR DISCUSSION: the serial number is included in order to make DNS
   response messages of type ZONEMD meaningful.  Without the serial
   number, a stand-alone ZONEMD digest has no association to any
   particular zone file.  If there is agreement that ZONEMD responses
   are not useful, this field could be removed.  See also the end of
   Security Considerations.

3.1.2.  The Digest Type Field

   The Digest Type field is an 8-bit unsigned integer, with meaning
   equivalent to the Digest Type of the DS resource record, as defined
   in section 5.1.3 of [RFC4034].

   The status of ZONEMD digest types (e.g., mandatory, optional,
   deprecated) SHALL always match the status for DS records.  This
   information can be found in the IANA protocol registry for DS digest
   types [iana-ds-digest-types].

   At the time of this writing the following digest types are defined:

            +-------+-----------------+-----------+-----------+
            | Value | Description     | Status    | Reference |
            +-------+-----------------+-----------+-----------+
            | 1     | SHA1            | Mandatory | [RFC3658] |
            | 2     | SHA256          | Mandatory | [RFC4509] |
            | 3     | GOST R 34.11-94 | Optional  | [RFC5933] |
            | 4     | SHA384          | Optional  | [RFC6605] |
            +-------+-----------------+-----------+-----------+

                           Table 1: Digest Types

3.1.3.  The Digest Field

   The Digest field is a variable-length sequence of octets containing
   the message digest.  Section 4 describes how to calculate the digest
   for a zone.  Section 5 describes how to use the digest to verify the
   contents of a zone.

3.2.  ZONEMD Presentation Format

   The presentation format of the RDATA portion is as follows:

   The Serial field MUST be represented as an unsigned decimal integer.

   The Digest Type field MUST be represented as an unsigned decimal
   integer.

   The Digest MUST be represented as a sequence of case-insensitive
   hexadecimal digits.  Whitespace is allowed within the hexadecimal
   text.

4.  Calculating the Digest

4.1.  Canonical Format and Ordering

   Calculation of the zone digest REQUIRES the RRs in a zone to be in a
   consistent format and ordering.  Correct ordering of the zone depends
   on (1) ordering of owner names in the zone, (2) ordering of RRsets
   with the same owner name, and (3) ordering of RRs within an RRset.

   This specification adopts DNSSEC's canonical ordering for names
   (Section 6.1 of [RFC4034]), and canonical ordering for RRs within an
   RRset (Section 6.3 of [RFC4034]).  It also adopts DNSSEC's canonical
   RR form (Section 6.2 of [RFC4034]).  However, since DNSSEC does not
   define a canonical ordering for RRsets having the same owner name,
   that ordering is defined here.

4.1.1.  Order of RRsets Having the Same Owner Name

   For the purposes of calculating the zone digest, RRsets having the
   same owner name MUST first be ordered by their numeric RR CLASS, and
   second by their numeric RR TYPE.

4.1.2.  Special Considerations for SOA RRs

   When AXFR is used to transfer zone data, the first and last records
   are always the SOA RR ([RFC5936] Section 2.2).  Because of this, zone
   files on disk often contain two SOA RRs.  When calculating the zone
   digest, the first SOA RR MUST be included and any subsequent SOA RRs
   MUST NOT be included.

   Additionally, per established practices, the SOA record is generally
   the first record in a zone file.  However, according to the
   requirement to sort RRsets with the same owner name by type, the SOA
   RR (type value 2) might not be first in the digest calculation.  If
   the zone has an A RR (type value 1) at the apex, it MUST be processed
   before the SOA RR.

Internet-Draft               DNS Zone Digest                  March 2018


4.2.  Add ZONEMD Placeholder

   In preparation for calculating the zone digest, any existing ZONEMD
   records MUST first be deleted from the zone.

   Prior to calculation of the digest, and prior to signing with DNSSEC,
   a placeholder ZONEMD record MUST be added to the zone.  This serves
   two purposes: (1) it allows the digest to cover the Serial and Digest
   Type field values, and (2) ensures that appropriate denial-of-
   existence (NSEC, NSEC3) records are created if the zone is signed
   with DNSSEC.

   In the placeholder record, the Serial field MUST be set to the
   current SOA Serial.  The Digest Type field MUST be set to the value
   for the chosen digest algorithm.  The Digest field MUST be set to all
   zeroes and of length appropriate for the chosen digest algorithm.

4.3.  Optionally Sign the Zone

   Following addition of the placeholder record, the zone MAY be signed
   with DNSSEC.  Note that when the digest calculation is complete, and
   the ZONEMD record is updated, the signature(s) for that record MUST
   be recalculated and updated as well.

4.4.  Calculate the Digest

   The zone digest is calculated by concatenating the canonical form of
   RRs in the zone, in the order described above, subject to the
   inclusion/exclusion rules described below, and then applying the
   digest algorithm:

   digest = digest_algorithm( RR(1) | RR(2) | RR(3) | ... )

   where "|" denotes concatenation, and

   RR(i) = owner | type | class | TTL | RDATA length | RDATA

4.4.1.  Inclusion/Exclusion Rules

   When calculating the digest, the following inclusion/exclusion rules
   apply:

   o  More than one SOA MUST NOT be included.

   o  The placeholder ZONEMD RR MUST be included.

   o  If the zone is signed, DNSSEC RRs MUST be included, except:

Internet-Draft               DNS Zone Digest                  March 2018


   o  The RRSIG covering ZONEMD MUST NOT be included.

4.5.  Update ZONEMD RR

   Once the zone digest has been calculated, its value is then copied to
   the Digest field of the ZONEMD record.

   If the zone is signed with DNSSEC, the appropriate RRSIG records
   covering the ZONEMD record MUST then be added.  Because the ZONEMD
   placeholder was added prior to signing, the zone will already have
   the appropriate denial-of-existence (NSEC, NSEC3) records.

5.  Verifying Zone Message Digest

   The recipient of a zone that has a message digest record can verify
   the zone by calculating the digest as follows:

   1.  The verifier SHOULD first determine whether or not to expect
       DNSSEC records in the zone.  This can be done by examining
       locally configured trust anchors, or querying for (and
       validating) DS RRs in the parent zone.  For zones that are
       provably unsigned, digest validation continues at step 4 below.

   2.  For zones that are provably signed, the existence of the ZONEMD
       record MUST be verified.  If the ZONEMD record provably does not
       exist, digest verification cannot be done.  If the ZONEMD record
       does provably exist, but is not found in the zone, digest
       verification MUST NOT be considered successful.

   3.  For zones that are provably signed, the SOA RR and ZONEMD RR(set)
       MUST have valid signatures, chaining up to a trust anchor.  If
       DNSSEC validation of the SOA or ZONEMD records fails, digest
       verification MUST NOT be considered successful.

   4.  The SOA Serial field MUST exactly match the ZONEMD Serial field.
       If the fields to not match, digest verification MUST NOT be
       considered successful.

   5.  The ZONEMD Digest Type field MUST be checked.  If the verifier
       does not support the given digest type, it SHOULD report that the
       zone digest could not be verified due to an unsupported
       algorithm.

   6.  The zone digest is calculated using the algorithm described in
       Section 4.4.  Note in particular that the Digest field of any
       ZONEMD RRs MUST be zeroed prior to calculation of the digest.

Internet-Draft               DNS Zone Digest                  March 2018


   7.  The calculated digest is compared to the received digest.  If the
       two digest values match, verification is considered successful.
       Otherwise, verification MUST NOT be considered successful.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  ZONEMD RRtype

   This document uses a new DNS RR type, ZONEMD, whose value TBD has
   been allocated by IANA from the "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs"
   subregistry of the "Domain Name System (DNS) Parameters" registry.

6.2.  ZONEMD Digest Type

   The ZONEMD Digest Type field has the same semantics as the DS RR
   Digest Type field.  Thus, it does not add new IANA protocol registry
   requirements.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Attacks Against the Zone Digest

   The zone digest allows the receiver to verify that the zone contents
   haven't been modified since the zone was generated/published.
   Verification is strongest when the zone is also signed with DNSSEC.
   An attacker, whose goal is to modify zone content before it is used
   by the victim, may consider a number of different approaches.

   The attacker might perform a downgrade attack to an unsigned zone.
   This is why Section 5 RECOMMENDS that the verifier determine whether
   or not to expect DNSSEC signatures for the zone in step 1.

   The attacker might perform a downgrade attack by removing the ZONEMD
   record.  This is why Section 5 REQUIRES that the verifier checks
   DNSSEC denial-of-existence proofs in step 2.

   The attacker might alter the Digest Type or Digest fields of the
   ZONEMD record.  Such modifications are detectable only with DNSSEC
   validation.

7.2.  Attacks Utilizing the Zone Digest

   Nothing in this specification prevents clients from making, and
   servers from responding to, ZONEMD queries.  One might consider how
   well ZONEMD responses could be used in a distributed denial-of-
   service amplification attack.

Internet-Draft               DNS Zone Digest                  March 2018


   The ZONEMD RR is moderately sized, much like the DS RR.  A single
   ZONEMD RR contributes approximately 40 to 65 octets to a DNS
   response, for currently defined digest types.  Certainly other query
   types result in larger amplification effects (i.e., DNSKEY).

   FOR DISCUSSION: The primary purpose of the ZONEMD record is to verify
   a zone file prior to being loaded or served by a name server.  We
   could allow a name server implementation to respond to ZONEMD queries
   with the REFUSED RCODE without loss of functionality.

8.  Privacy Considerations

   This specification has no impacts on user privacy.

10.  Implementation Status

10.1.  Authors' Implementation

   The authors are currently working on an implementation in C, using
   the ldns library [ldns].  This implementation is able to perform the
   following functions:

   o  Read input zone file, output zone file with ZONEMD placeholder.

   o  Compute zone digest over signed zone file and update ZONEMD
