masterfile format allows some fields to be omitted / inherited.
e.g. ownername and TTL.  Can be a challenge for digest calculation.

All RRs in an RRset should have the same TTL, but maybe they don't,
in violation of RFC 2181.  As long as the TTLs aren't changed between
publisher and recipient, ZONEMD should still work.  But for zones that
have varying TTLs in an RRset ZONEMD may not be reliable.

Some RR types have Domain Name fields that are not subject to
canonicalization.  e.g. NSEC, as clarified in RFC 6840.  It means that
for those RRs case must always be preserved.
